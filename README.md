# DT Probiotics Data Champion Assignment

This project is an analysis and prediction model built on the **DT Probiotics Data**. It includes an **Automated Dashboard** using **Streamlit** and a **Google Colab notebook** for the dataset analysis and machine learning modeling. 

## Overview

This project aims to:
1. Clean and preprocess the dataset.
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Apply multiple machine learning models, including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
4. Display key visualizations including:
   - Scatter plot of **Revenue vs Growth Rate**
   - Correlation Matrix Heatmap
   - Distribution of prospects by **Industry** and **Location**
5. Provide an option to download the processed data.
